# DG + AssetCore Example (Planned)

This document will host the flagship DG + AssetCore example once a public,
OSS-safe scenario is selected.

Selection criteria:
- DG requirement evaluation strength in a real system.
- Why ASC is required as the world-state substrate.
- How the same pattern generalizes to other domains.

Status tracking: [F:Docs/roadmap/README.md L73-L81](../../roadmap/README.md#L73-L81).
