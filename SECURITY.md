# Security

Decision Gate is built with a Zero Trust posture. Inputs are treated as hostile
and disclosure decisions fail closed on missing or unverifiable evidence.

See `Docs/security/threat_model.md` for the full threat model, trust boundaries,
and failure posture. Operational controls are documented in
`Docs/guides/security_guide.md`.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it privately to
the project maintainers.
