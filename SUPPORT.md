# Support

Decision Gate is maintained by a solo maintainer. There is no SLA.

## What To Use

- Bugs, docs corrections, and feature ideas: open an issue.
- Issue templates live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and are the preferred entry point.
- Security concerns: follow `SECURITY.md` and report privately.
- Enterprise questions: email support@assetcore.io.

## Scope

- The OSS repository does not accept pull requests.
- Issues are triaged based on security, correctness, and alignment with the
  project’s deterministic and audit-first goals.
- Responses are best-effort.
